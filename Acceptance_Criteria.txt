A simple WordScraper using Test Driven Development exercise.

Acceptance Criteria - Conditions that the software must satisfy
- The application should be able to provide a list of words to be unscambled     
  either manually or as a file.
- The process of unscramling will be based on a external file (which is a list of    
  words per line).
- The process of comparing the words togheter should not care for any language   
  specific rules and should be case insensitive.

Algorithm - logical thought process of the application
- Get input from user
      If option is manual then ask user to enter word or words /w comma seperation       
      If option is file then ask user to enter the full path including the name
         If the file is not recognized show warning. Ask if user want to continue
	    If user chooses yes, then go to first step
	    If user chooses not, then exit
      If option is not recognized then show warning and ask if user wants to continue
 	 If user choose yes, then go to fist step
	 If user choose no, then exit
      Load the word list  specified by the user unscrambling the given scrambled words
      Start matching scrambled words against the loaded word list
         For each scrambled word in specified scrambled words
	    For each unscrambled word in word list
	       If scramble word == unscrambled word then add to list of mached
	       Else 
		   Sort scrambled word
		   Sort unscrambled word
	 If matches found then show matched scrambled words for all unscramled words
	 Else show message that no matches have been found
      Ask if user wants to continue
